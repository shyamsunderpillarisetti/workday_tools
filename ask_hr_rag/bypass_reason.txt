Temporary TLS bypass is enabled for local debugging because the environment injects a self-signed or corporate MITM certificate that is not trusted by the default CA store. For rapid testing we set RAG_DISABLE_SSL_VERIFY=true (or ASKHR_DISABLE_SSL_VERIFY), which disables certificate verification for outgoing HTTPS calls. This should not be used in production; the proper fix is to trust the corporate root CA (set REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE/SSL_CERT_FILE to the PEM) or configure outbound egress without interception.
