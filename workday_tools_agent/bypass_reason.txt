Temporary TLS bypass is enabled for local debugging because the environment 
injects a self-signed or corporate MITM certificate that is not trusted by 
the default CA store. For rapid testing we set ASKHR_DISABLE_SSL_VERIFY=true, 
which disables certificate verification for outgoing HTTPS calls. 
This should not be used in production; 
the proper fix is to trust the corporate root CA (set REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE/SSL_CERT_FILE to the PEM) 
or configure outbound egress without interception
